Action Everywhere is a Getting Things Done (GTDÂ®) action list manager for Thinking Rock (www.trgtd.com.au). 
It shows your Thinking Rock action lists, using Dropbox to sync your Thinking Rock data file.
The app has been designed to work with Thinking Rock 3.4.2. It does not seem to work correctly since Thinking Rock 3.6.0.
