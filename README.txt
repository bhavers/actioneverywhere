Importing
- The author used Eclipse 3.7 and 4.2 as IDE with ADT. 
- You should have at least SDK 2.2 Level 8 installed 
- When importing the project in Eclipse you might receive override errors. Set the java compiler for the project 
to 1.6 (defaults to 1.5). See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1678122/must-override-a-superclass-method-errors-after-importing-a-project-into-eclips
